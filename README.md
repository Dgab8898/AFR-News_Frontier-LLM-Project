    "In this project, you experienced calling the Cloud API of a Frontier Model (a leading model at the frontier of AI) for the first time. We will be using APIs like OpenAI at many stages in the course, in addition to building our own LLMs.\n",
    "More specifically, we've applied this to Summarization - a classic Gen AI use case to make a summary. This can be applied to any business vertical - summarizing the Australian Financial Review news, this could apply Summarization in your business, and try prototyping a solution."
